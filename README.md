# Twitter Clone

This is a **Twitter Clone** application built using vanilla JavaScript. The app simulates the core functionalities of Twitter, allowing users to tweet, like, retweet, and reply to posts. It's a simple, interactive project aimed at practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content rendering.

## Features

### Core Functionality
1. **Tweet Creation**:
   - Users can write and post tweets.
   - Tweets are added to the top of the feed.

2. **Like & Unlike**:
   - Click the heart icon to like or unlike a tweet.
   - The like count updates dynamically.

3. **Retweet & Undo Retweet**:
   - Retweet a post to increment the retweet count.
   - Undo a retweet to decrement the count.

4. **Reply to Tweets**:
   - Click the reply icon to toggle the reply section.
   - Add replies to specific tweets, which are displayed in a nested format under the parent tweet.

### Dynamic Rendering
- All interactions dynamically update the content on the page without refreshing.
- User data is handled using a mock database (`tweetsData`).
